'''The Task
Implement the strstr() function from string.h in the C standard library.
Thisfunction is also known as index() in Perl, find() in Python, and indexOf() inJava and JavaScript.
The function should take two string parameters, short_str and long_str 
(note that these are just the variable names, not types), 
and return the first occurrence of short_str in long_str as a 0-based index into long_str.
If short_str does not exist in long_str, the function should return -1.
You should provide a suite of test data along with your implementation.

Constraints

You may implement the function in Perl, Python, or C, but you MUST NOT use highlevel language 
facilities such as regular expressions or multi-character stringcomparisons.
If you choose to implement in C, you may return a char * that points to the
character from long_str where the match begins, or NULL if short_str is not
found.This should be written as "production quality" code, meaning that it should
be code you'd be willing to check in to a production tree. No extraneous
debug statements, exit() calls, or anything else that would disturb
production code.
The solution should be expressed in a single file with no outside
dependencies. It should contain at least one function named strstr() that
performs the task, and one function named test() that returns a true value if
the strstr() function passes all testcases. You may factor strstr() into
multiple functions if you like.
